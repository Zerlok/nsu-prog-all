C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language.
It supports structured programming, lexical variable scope and
recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended
operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to
typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in
applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language,
including operating systems, as well as various application software
for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.

C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at
AT&T Bell Labs, and used to (re-)implement the Unix operating system.
It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages
of all time, with C compilers from various vendors available for 
the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems.
C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO).

Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C,
including C++, D, Go, Rust, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, C#,
Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Verilog (hardware description language),
and Unix's C shell. These languages have drawn many of their control
structures and other basic features from C, usually with overall
syntactical similarity to C that sometimes includes identical simple
control structures. C is also used as an intermediate language for other
languages, and for building standard libraries and runtime systems for
higher-level languages, such as CPython.
